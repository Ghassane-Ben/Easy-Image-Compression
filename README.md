# Easy-Image-Compression

This web application allows to compress images effortlessly by setting a compression percentage. This value determines the compression quality, meaning how much quality you will remove from the image. Higher input values will imply higher quality reduction and consequently size reduction. Simply choose an image, set the compression percentage, and click the "Compress Image" button.
The web application is simple and intuitive to use and the compression is done using Python's Pillow library for efficient results.
